React Splurge

States are variables that store the state of UI, that means they are dynamic & used to render UI conditionally.

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearanc

//Earlier JS:

Large JS apps became fragile because:

Scripts executed immediately

Everything was global

Dependencies were implicit

Order mattered

JS wasn’t designed for large apps

developers hacked “modularity” into JavaScript using patterns:
The IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): [Encaps.]
Function creates a new scope

Immediately executed

Nothing leaks to window unless you expose it

    But:

Dependencies were still fragile

Load order still mattered

Tooling couldn’t reason about code

Developers wanted:

Node-style imports

npm packages

Clean architecture
Browsers couldn’t do that.

👉 This is why bundlers were invented.

        Bundler does:

Starts from entry file

Resolves imports

Builds dependency graph

Converts everything to plain JS

Outputs browser-ready files


Why modern tools changed approach
Key insight (Vite, Snowpack):

Browsers already understand ES modules.

So instead of:

bundle → serve


They do:

serve modules directly
→ transform only what’s requested
→ let browser handle imports
