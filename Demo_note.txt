React Splurge

States are variables that store the state of UI, that means they are dynamic & used to render UI conditionally.

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearanc

Synthetic Events (React’s wrapper around native events) React handles: Event delegation Cleanup on component unmount
 
//Earlier JS:

Large JS apps became fragile because:

Scripts executed immediately

Everything was global

Dependencies were implicit

Order mattered

JS wasn’t designed for large apps

developers hacked “modularity” into JavaScript using patterns:
The IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): [Encaps.]
Function creates a new scope

Immediately executed

Nothing leaks to window unless you expose it

    But:

Dependencies were still fragile

Load order still mattered

Tooling couldn’t reason about code

Developers wanted:

Node-style imports

npm packages

Clean architecture
Browsers couldn’t do that.

👉 This is why bundlers were invented.

        Bundler does:

Starts from entry file

Resolves imports

Builds dependency graph

Converts everything to plain JS

Outputs browser-ready files


Why modern tools changed approach
Key insight (Vite, Snowpack):

Browsers already understand ES modules.

So instead of:

bundle → serve


They do:

serve modules directly
→ transform only what’s requested
→ let browser handle imports


Event Listeners 
-> Capture: ancestors have access,
-> Target: both parent as well as child have access
-> bubble: child -> parent -> ancestor
Event Delgation:
When a click happens:

Browser triggers native event

React intercepts it at the root

React figures out which component fired it

React manually propagates the event through the React Fiber tree

What Is the Fiber Tree?

The Fiber Tree is:(2 of these are maintained)

A linked tree of Fiber nodes

Each Fiber node corresponds to one React element

Stored in memory (not the DOM)

Used for reconciliation, rendering, and event handling
